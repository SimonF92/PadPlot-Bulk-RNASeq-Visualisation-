# Padplot is a modular python based program which allows end-users with virtually 
no python experience to create publication quality plots from their RNA-Seq datasets. 

Padplot achieves this by operating a Tkinter GUI. Code runs in the background but is
based on options selected in the built-in GUI- giving the end-user control over their plots.



Padplot is probably not written for the person reading this, it is meant for people with no 
experience in code. However, in its current state it still requires an install of python and 
has several dependencies.

The idea is that you can get the script running for your colleagues and basically leave them to it,
as it is based on a Tkinter GUI so doesnt require any knowledge of python to run.

It removes the need for;

"Hey computational bioligist person can you,
change the colour of my heatmap?
add more samples to the pca?
change the padj threshold of the plot?
label certain genes that are in a pathway?

Just give them padplot and let them run it
